### Travel Planner Application

#### Problem Statement
Planning a trip can be overwhelming due to the many aspects involved, such as itineraries, accommodations, and activities. A travel planner application can streamline the process, helping users organize their travel plans efficiently.

#### Project Idea
Create a travel planner application using HTML, CSS, and JavaScript that allows users to create and manage their travel itineraries, accommodations, activities, and packing lists in a user-friendly interface.

#### Project Components
- Create, Read, Update, Delete (CRUD) Tasks:
    - Enable users to create new itineraries with details like destination, travel dates, activities, and accommodations using forms.
    - Display a list of itineraries in the dashboard in a card format, showcasing essential information.
    - Allow users to edit and update itinerary details directly in the dashboard.
    - Provide the option to delete itineraries accordingly.

- Activity and Accommodation Management:
    - Allow users to add, edit, and delete activities and accommodations for each itinerary.
    - Display activities and accommodations in a list or calendar format under each itinerary for easy reference.

- Packing List:
    - Implement a feature that allows users to create and manage a packing list for each trip.
    - Enable users to add items to the packing list and mark them as packed once ready.

- Search and Filter Tasks:
    - Implement search functionality to allow users to quickly find itineraries based on destination or keywords.
    - Provide filter options to narrow down itineraries by travel dates or specific activities.

- Basic Dashboard Dashboard with Trip Statistics:
    - Display a simple dashboard showing statistics such as the total number of planned trips, upcoming trips, and completed trips.
    - Update the statistics dynamically as itineraries are added, edited, or deleted.

- User-Friendly Interface:
    - Design an intuitive interface with clear navigation to enhance user experience.
    - Use CSS styles to visually distinguish between different itinerary statuses (upcoming, completed).

#### NOTE

- **Use the browserâ€™s local storage to save and retrieve saved tasks, ensuring that the data persists across page reloads. Implement functions to save tasks to local storage and load them when the application starts.**
